1. Package and Import Statements: The code starts with the package declaration and import statements to import necessary packages and dependencies.

3. Global Variables: Global variables are declared to hold the MongoDB client, collections, validation instance, and JWT key.

5. Structs: The code defines several structs to represent the data models used in the application, such as UserData and ArticleData. These structs have corresponding JSON tags for parsing and encoding data.

7. Handle Functions: The code defines multiple handler functions to handle different API endpoints.
	- **handlePostRequestRouting**: This function routes the POST requests to the appropriate handler based on the request path.

	- **handleGetArticlesRequest**: Retrieves all articles from the MongoDB collection and returns them as a JSON response.

	- **handleDeleteArticleByTitle**: Deletes an article from the MongoDB collection based on its title.

	- **handleDeleteUserByID**: Deletes a user from the MongoDB collection based on their _id.

	- **handleGetUserByID**: Retrieves a user from the MongoDB collection based on their _id.

	- **handleGetArticlesByTitle**: Retrieves articles from the MongoDB collection based on their title.

	- **handleLoginRequest**: Handles the login request, validates the user's credentials, and generates a JWT token.

	- **handleRegisterRequest**: Handles the registration request, validates the user's data, and stores it in the MongoDB collection.

5. Helper Functions:
	- **validateEmail**: Validates the format of an email address using a regular expression.

	- **getUserByEmail**: Retrieves a user from the MongoDB collection based on their email address.

###### Overall, this code defines a basic API with user registration, login, and article management functionalities using AWS Lambda and MongoDB. The handlers handle different HTTP methods and route requests to the corresponding functions to perform the required operations on the MongoDB collections
